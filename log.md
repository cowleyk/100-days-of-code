# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, Monday

**Today's Goal**: Dev solely in vim. Set up DBs. *Stretch*: Bash script to teardown/remake dbs

**Today's Progress**: Got a chart rendering in UI scaffold. Got initial postgres table set up.

**Thoughts**: New nio binary is causing problems. Need to find help for it.  Developing in vim in a PITA

**Link(s) to work**
1. n/a

### Day 2: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Goal**: Pick an API, get block set up, start populating local DB

**Today's Progress**: Discovered super simple GDAX api. Connected and got data I currently want.
 
**Thoughts**: Coinigy/Poloniex APIs seem poorly maintained, 
can successfully curl requests to Coinigy but cannot read JSON responses with Requests library. 
GDAX was awesome and simple and what I want. Going to kick the can down the road and deal with Poloniex || Coinigy 
when I want to start live trading.
